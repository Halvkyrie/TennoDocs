# Banshee - \[Savage Silence]

## Introduction

This is the main page for runs specifically using Banshee's Silence ability with the \[Savage Silence] Augment mod. This builds upon what was already written in the Methods page. Gloom is preferable as this can massively extend the duration of Silence's stun

### Using Silence is most suitable for: Everything!

Yes, Silence, when paired with Gloom, is suitable to level anything mentioned on the main page. Without Gloom however, It's most suitable for leveling Frames or Melee Weapons

### \[Savage Silence] - Why?

The \[Savage Silence] augment mod has an unwritten effect of entirely locking the alertness state of affected enemies for the duration of the stun. The enemy perception is also generally lowered from Silence. Enemies, including Eximus units, will also not perceive that they are being attacked, as long as they cannot see the projectile etc. This means that if you stand behind an eximus enemy and have Silence active, you are able to shoot it, with multiple shots, until it dies, without ever alerting it. If done right, that is.\


## Builds

Some build suggestions. Once again, these are suggestions, not absolutes

### With Gloom

### A few things to note

Here the Gloom slow is not capped. This reaches about 93% slow, whereas 95% is the limit. You may replace Umbral Intensify with Transient Fortitude to achieve the maximum 95% slow. This will have a slightly higher drain/lower duration however.\
Primed Sure Footed is recommended if using AOE weapons. Generally nice to have, but not necessary. Unairu's Poise can substitute this.\
Without running gloom, there is a lot of space for everything. My preferred range is 64%. Beyond using \[Savage Silence] and some duration + achieving the desired range, the rest is flexible.\
Arcanes are flavour, but not necessary.

## Running

Make sure to put your knowledge from the Main page and Methods page to use. \
Note that Eximus units will not be slowed by Gloom, nor stunned by Silence while their Overguard is up.

To start, it's advisable to fill up on energy, such as via Team Energy Restores. Cast Gloom, and cast Silence. As long as you have energy, Gloom is "Set and Forget". You will have to keep an eye on the timer for Silence however. Keep silence active at all times. You may notice that the audio is slightly muffled while Silence is active, and that there is an audio effect when Silence ends.

Pay attention to your Silence stun/effect range, and your Gloom slow range. The range of Silence is greater than Gloom, so being on the move is beneficial to make sure that the stun does not end before the enemy enters the slow range. You can also get away with walking out of the silence range for an enemy, and walking in again, to stun it again.

Companions, especially Sentinels and Moas, can be used with their weapons (such as Verglas) to kill enemies that are semi/fully alerted, without affecting your stealth affinity bonus chain. By default, companions only attack enemies that are semi or fully alerted, and not unalerted enemies. This makes for an easy and lazy way to clean up any undesirable enemies, should you get spotted.

Killing the enemies can be done more or less however you want. Try to be quick. While gloom will greatly extend the Silence stun duration, it is not infinite. You might want to leave lone enemies far out alone, to avoid other bigger groups of enemies having their stun end. Likewise, if you've been in an area killing enemies for a while, it might be wise to move onward, or to exit and reenter the area to stun them again, if you are really desperate for the affinity per run.\
Similarly to using Equinox, a fast, long range melee, such as a polearm is a good idea. This will benefit from Naramon's Affinity Spike too, which is great when farming focus.

When farming affinity for amps, you will want to frequently transfer in, then transfer out, to place your banshee near enemies to stun and slow them while you kill the enemies with your amp.

When running _without_ gloom, your opportunity to kill an enemy is rather short. This is why the range in the suggested build is relatively low with 64%. You want to kill the enemy as soon as possible after you get close enough to stun it with silence. This is arguably the most difficult of the different methods.
