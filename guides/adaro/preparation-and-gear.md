# Preparation and Gear

## The Basic gear

### Banshee or Equinox

The basis of this guide is using Equinox' Rest, or Banshee's augmented Silence ability. For Banshee, the **Savage Silence** augment is required

### Melee

A melee weapon is considered the "standard" for doing Adaro. You should have a reasonably good melee weapon that can handle level 30-40 grineer. Ranged melees are preferable. Note that the "power" of the melee weapon doesn't have to be high, as long as you keep your stealth going. Stealth melee attacks deal 8x Damage (Does not have to be a finisher attack).

## Farming Focus

### Lua Lenses

First of all, prepare by getting some Focus lenses. Lua lenses are the most preferable, and are a worthwhile investment, knowing that this will effectivize your focus farming by a lot. The focus lenses will be used by your gear of choice.&#x20;

### Naramon Affinity Spike

Second, Unlock the Naramon Focus School and unlock + rank up the Affinity Spike Focus Node. Affinity Spike will increase affinity gained by Melee kills by 45%, which translates into more focus. This is also one of the reasons why melee is advisable for focus farming

## Leveling Warframes

### Helminth Segment

#### Banshee or Equinox Subsumed

The basis for self-leveling Warframes is using either Rest and Rage, from Equinox, or Silence, from Banshee, with the Savage Silence augment. The best course of action is to replace your 1st ability with either of these depending on which method you prefer. This is because your 1st ability will always be unlocked, and it's also the ability that reaches max ability rank first. If you are Mastery Rank 30 or above, and you're using forma, the ability slot you replace is unimportant since all abilities will start at max rank on a polarized Warframe.

## Leveling Weapons

> This also includes Operator Amps, and Archguns
>
> Note: Melee is excempt from this (minus gunblades), as Banshee's passive ability isn't required.

### Helminth Segment

#### Sevagoth Subsumed

The Helminth segment and a subsumed Sevagoth to unlock the Gloom ability is required, because Gloom is used to greatly extend the stun duration of Savage Silence. Gloom slows down affected targets, which includes slowing down the stun animation. The stun duration is tied to the animation.

### Banshee

#### Gloom infused

Banshee is used because of (Savage) Silence, and her passive ability that makes all weapons behave silently. This includes gunblades and archguns too, which are weapon types that cannot normally be turned silent via mods. Silent weaponry is important to avoid alerting enemies.&#x20;

## Leveling Archguns

### Archgun Deployer

Gravimag installed on the archgun in question is also required, so you can actually deploy it in a mission. Yes, this means you have to reach Rank 5 with Solaris United and complete the Profit Taker heist setup.

## Leveling Companions

### Nothing!

Leveling a companion doesn't require anything special. Just be sure to either unequip the companion weapon or to unequip the attack precept. Moas and Hounds can attack without an attack precept though, so yes, they _might_ cause a bit of a pain for you but it should not cause too many issues.
