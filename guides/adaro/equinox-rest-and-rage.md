# Equinox - Rest (and Rage)

## Introduction

This is the main page for runs specifically using Equinox' 2nd ability, Rest and Rage. This builds upon what was already written as the general course in the Methods page.\
Rest is commonly referred to as "sleep" too, which will be done for parts of this guide.

### Using Rest and Rage is most suitable for:

* Warframes
* Melee weapons
* Companions
* Companion Weapons

### Rest vs Rage

Rest is the actual ability being used, so for Equinox you have to be in Night form, and for frames with Rest and Rage infused via Helminth, your frame's energy colour should be set to a dark type of colour to set your "form", as you cannot switch during the mission. Which form is used by default is also indicated with a little icon next to your chosen colours, as shown in the examples below.

## Builds

These are some builds and notes around them. Note that just like the rest of this guide, these are not absolutes. You are free to change things if they suit you better.

### General Equinox Build suggestion

![A General build suggestion for Equinox.](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (2).png>)

This is the suggested build for using Equinox/Rest and Rage for Adaro. Note that the arcanes are not necessary whatsoever.

#### A few things to note:

No. 7 forma is not necessary for this. That is just the combined total of forma spent on this equinox. The image shows multiple mismatching polarities too, since this has more polarization for other builds, that aren't required for this build.

Vigilante Pursuit in the Exilus slot isn't necessary. This is just there to add to an already good radar range by pairing Enemy Radar and Primed Animal Instinct.

The augment Calm & Frenzy is in place because it makes the sleep effect spread when a target is killed. This allows for fewer casts throughout the mission, and you having to "pause" to keep casting sleep, instead spreading the effect forward as you keep killing enemies. This does obviously also have its limits. Some players might prefer using more duration via Augur Message etc.

### Prioritizing on unfinished Frames

While you're still ranking up your warframe, and not simply farming focus, you might be limited in your mods because of a lowered base capacity.&#x20;

#### Recommended Priority

* 235%-265% Range
* 170% or 175% Efficiency
* 100% or better Duration

After that, you can spend remaining mod capacity on things such as Natural Talent, increasing duration/range, and using the Calm & Frenzy augment.

## Running

Once you're prepared in the mission, this should be your general way to go about\
Note that Rest and Rage does not affect Eximus units while their overguard is up.

As you move through rooms, cast Rest aka Sleep repeatedly to put all the units accessible in the room to sleep. If you're unsure, just cast until the game doesn't let you cast anymore, since the ability doesn't work if it has no targetable enemies within range. The cast point of Rest and Rage is based on where you are looking/aiming. Keep an eye out for Eximus units as always.&#x20;

While the enemies are asleep, swiftly kill the enemies with your melee weapon. If your weapon is particularly weak you _might_ want to use finishers, but you _do not need to perform finisher kills to gain stealth xp_ nor to benefit from the 8x melee stealth damage multiplier.

Keep an eye on the timer shown on your ability. It displays the remaining duration for your Rest effect. Note that it only shows the timer for the effect that has the most remaining duration.

With melee, slide attacks can be very effective as they usually cover a wide area, and allow you to keep your speed up.&#x20;
