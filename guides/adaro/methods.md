# Methods

Primarily, you can split this into two methods. Equinox and Banshee. Depending on what you're leveling (or farming focus with), there are some variations in how you proceed. Despite separating this into separate methods, there is a lot of common ground. The purpose of this page is to further explain the main concepts of doing Adaro, so you can understand _how_ and _why_ it works. You can return here to help find out how to deal with the things you might be having issues with, such as eximus units.

## The important stuff

When you do an Adaro run, these things are going to be the most important elements for your success

### Stealth Kill Affinity Bonus

#### Gaining the bonus

Performing a Stealth Kill on an enemy gives you a Stealth Kill Affinity Bonus. This gives a +100% affinity bonus on Stealth Kill. Subsequent Stealth Kills will give another +100% to your bonus, up to a total of +500% affinity per Stealth Kill, meaning **SIX** times the original affinity amount. The bonus has a 30 second duration, and refreshes with each Stealth Kill. This bonus is the reason why Adaro is so efficient

#### Losing the bonus

When you have an active stealth bonus, certain things can break the bonus. Breaking the bonus will remove it completely and instantly. There is no decay. When you kill an alerted enemy, or get hit by an alerted enemy, the stealth bonus is broken.

#### Maintaining the bonus

Maintaining the bonus is important. Every time the bonus breaks, you will have to perform 5 stealth kills to stack it fully again. Breaking the bonus too many times can be detrimental especially when leveling equipment, as you might not reach max rank in just 1 run.

There are a few "tricks" and things you can do to help maintain the bonus:

Kill alerted enemies with your Operator. Your Warframe and your Operator have separate stealth bonus buffs, meaning that to avoid breaking the bonus on one, you can kill off alerted enemies with the other.

"Skip" alerted enemies, and kill only unalerted enemies. Separating yourself from the Line of Sight (Referred to as LoS) of the enemy and allowing some time to pass will lower the alert state of  the enemy, given that there are no active alarms in the mission. This means you're not "wasting" enemies/kills from the max amount of enemies in the mission. If the distance between you and the former alerted enemy becomes too great the enemies will run closer to the are where you are (even if unalerted). If the distance becomes too great the existing enemies will be teleported ahead again and put "in place" where new enemies would have appeared. Often just going to the next room and staying out of LoS is enough.
