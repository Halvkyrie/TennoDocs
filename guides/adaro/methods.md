# Methods

Primarily, you can split this into two methods. Equinox and Banshee. Depending on what you're leveling (or farming focus with), there are some variations in how you proceed. Despite separating this into separate methods, there is a lot of common ground. The purpose of this page is to further explain the main concepts of doing Adaro, so you can understand _how_ and _why_ it works. You can return here to help find out how to deal with the things you might be having issues with, such as eximus units.

## The important stuff

When you do an Adaro run, these things are going to be the most important elements for your success

## Stealth Kill Affinity Bonus

### Gaining the bonus

Performing a Stealth Kill on an enemy gives you a Stealth Kill Affinity Bonus. This gives a +100% affinity bonus on Stealth Kill. Subsequent Stealth Kills will give another +100% to your bonus, up to a total of +500% affinity per Stealth Kill, meaning **SIX** times the original affinity amount. The bonus has a 30 second duration, and refreshes with each Stealth Kill. This bonus is the reason why Adaro is so efficient

### Losing the bonus

When you have an active stealth bonus, certain things can break the bonus. Breaking the bonus will remove it completely and instantly. There is no decay. When you kill an alerted enemy, or get hit by an alerted enemy, the stealth bonus is broken.

### Maintaining the bonus

Maintaining the bonus is important. Every time the bonus breaks, you will have to perform 5 stealth kills to stack it fully again. Breaking the bonus too many times can be detrimental especially when leveling equipment, as you might not reach max rank in just 1 run.

There are a few "tricks" and things you can do to help maintain the bonus:

**Kill alerted enemies with your Operator.** Your Warframe and your Operator have separate stealth bonus buffs, meaning that to avoid breaking the bonus on one, you can kill off alerted enemies with the other.

**"Skip" alerted enemies** and kill only unalerted enemies. Separating yourself from the Line of Sight (Referred to as LoS) of the enemy and allowing some time to pass will lower the alert state of  the enemy, given that there are no active alarms in the mission. This means you're not "wasting" enemies/kills from the max amount of enemies in the mission. If the distance between you and the former alerted enemy becomes too great the enemies will run closer to the are where you are (even if unalerted). If the distance becomes too great the existing enemies will be teleported ahead again and put "in place" where new enemies would have appeared. Often just going to the next room and staying out of LoS is enough.

## Enemy Radar and Alert states

### Enemy radar

> Enemy radar will show enemies on your minimap, indicated as red arrows. Special entities are indicated with yellow.

Enemy Radar is the best aura mod in the game. There. I said it. It's useful in pretty much any situation. It will reveal where enemies are on your minimap. it will show which direction they are facing, if they are at a higher or lower elevation compared to you, and will show their alert state. Enemy radar will help you anticipate the layout and progression of missions, and do nearly everything in the game with more efficiency. You will see what you cannot see (If you weren't using enemy radar).

The Enemy Radar range stacks, if you use multiple mods that give radar range, such as if multiple people in your squad are using the Enemy Radar aura, if you equip Enemy Radar and Vigilante Pursuit, or if you use (Primed) Animal Instinct on your companion. Running Primed Animal Instinct on all of your companions is suggested, even if you're not doing Adaro.

The effective are of enemy radar is a cylindrical shape. The range stat itself is the radius from your frame. The elevation range is somewhat limited, and does not increase beyond its initial size (Needs proper confirmation).

### Alert States

Enemies have 3 different alert states. Unalerted, Minor Alerted, and Alerted. By default, most enemies are unalerted. Certain enemies such as the Infested faction behave differently. This section will refer to only the Grineer faction units, more specifically the normal units encountered on Adaro.

**Unalerted enemies** are the only enemies you want to interact with. Though you might end up with unavoidable combat and alertness triggers which you have to deal with before continuing. Unalerted enemies will move and behave with a "default" behaviour. Unalerted enemies are generally poor at detecting enemy entities such as your Warframe, companion or Operator.

> Unalerted enemies are shown with only the outline of the triangle arrow on the minimap. The image shows 4 enemies. 3 unalerted, and 1 minor alerted close to the player.

**Minor Alerted enemies** are the enemies you would usually want to leave behind and "skip", to let them return to their unalerted state. These enemies do not know where the hostile entity is, but will break their default movement and behaviour pattern to find the potential enemy. Enemies will not attack in this state. Enemies in the Minor Alerted state will notice enemy entities much more easily than the unalerted enemies.

Enemies will change to the Minor Alerted state from from a few things, such as:\
Seeing a friendly corpse, Hearing a gunshot, Seeing a projectile, Hearing an ally die, or being touched by an enemy (Such as when a frame is invisible, but walks and "bumps" into an enemy)

While the alarms are triggered in a mission, all enemies will enter the minor alerted state by default (if they are not already alerted) and will not return to the unalered state until the alarms have been reset.

> ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png>)\
> Minor Alerted enemies are shown with both the outline triangle arrow, and a smaller triangle inside. The image shows many minor alerted enemies, and two alerted enemies.

**Alerted enemies** are problematic. These enemies are aware of the player (and for cases outside Adaro, this means opposing units in general). They will attack you/your companion. In the majority of cases, you have to deal with these enemies. As mentioned in the Stealth affinity section, being hit by these enemies, or killing them (as well as minor alerted enemies) will reset your stealth bonus.

Alerted enemies will not only attack with their weapons, but will also use their abilities such as eximus abilities, and can throw grenades, fire area-of-effect weapons like the Ogris, and so on.

> Alerted enemies are shown with a fully coloured triangle arrow. The image shows multiple alerted enemies near the player, and some minor alerted enemies further ahead in the mission map.

### Alarms and Alerted enemies

**Reset the Alarms.** Only then can the enemies return to their unalerted state after being left to their own for a while.&#x20;

**Avoid minor alerted enemies,** if there are no fully alerted enemies. You will be traversing the map and using abilities to stun enemies making them unable to perceive you. Keep doing this against the minor alerted enemies, but move away from them, put physical cover between you and the enemies to avoid getting spotted. If there's just one or two minor alerted enemies, the best course of action is often to switch from frame to operator (or vice versa, when leveling an amp) and killing the units.&#x20;

**Alerted enemies are contagious.** They will send nearby enemies into the minor alerted state, which quickly changes into the alerted state as they spot you. Kill these at all cost. The most important is to contain the spread of alertness. You would do this by stunning enemies and preventing them from interacting with other allies and generating more noise.

Equinox can be considered the best at handling this, due to her having a fast casting ability which is casted where you are aiming, which immediately tethers and puts enemies to rest. The Operator arcane Magus Lockdown can be very helpful for preventing further spread of alertness, as the tethered enemies are unable to do anything, and their alertness state cannot change. At worst, kill off the group of alerted enemies and try to avoid getting spotted by minor alerted enemies. then wait for their alertness state to be lowered.&#x20;

## Moving through the mission

> Using the information regarding enemy alert states and enemy radar, this section explains how you progress through the mission.

### The general groove

With what the previous sections explain, you would already have the groundwork for how to progress through the mission. You start off by equipping the relevant gear (covered separately) and entering the mission. Your matchmaking should be set to solo, and you should be doing the regular version of the mission, not Steel Path/Void Fissure/Kuva Flood etc.&#x20;

Look around, and read your enemy radar. You will see where the enemies are, see which enemies are moving, and which aren't. Use your relevant abilities to stun etc. the enemies, and kill them while under the effect of these abilities, and remain unseen. Knowing if an enemy is affected by the relevant ability can generally be told by if the enemy is moving or not. Keep the stealth affinity streak going. For efficiency, it might not be the best to run back and kill the last enemy in a room. "95% is enough", especially if you have the active bonus of a Convergence Orb for focus.

### Focus: Maximize your Convergence Orbs

Convergence Orbs are the yellow pickups that appear in missions when you have gear with a focus lens installed. Picking up these will grant a 45 second buff that multiplies the focus converted from affinity via a focus lens by 10. The buff ends prematurely if you die or reach the daily focus cap.

With the Convergence buff active, your priority should be to get down as many kills as possible in the 45 second timeframe. Therefore you should not waste time cleaning up a few stray enemies in a big room, but instead move quickly to the next room, which would have a much higher enemy density. Using Lua lenses and having an active affinity booster will easily result in over 100k focus gained during the buff.

### Eximus Units

Since update 31.5 - Angels of the Zariman, Eximus units are no longer affected by most crowd controlling abilities, or their effect is severely diminished. This means the enemies will not be put to rest by Equinox, nor slowed by Gloom, or stunned by Silence.

**You must treat eximus units as unaffected units at all times**, because that is what they are. Stay out of their line of sight. While using melee, the best course of action is often to sneak up on them and to perform a finisher attack to ensure that you take them down in one hit and don't leave them alerted. \
However, it appears that Savage Silence will still hinder the communication of eximus units, as well as making them not notice that they are being attacked, given that they don't see a passing projectile, an enemy (you), or see a corpse, or any other thing that would change the alert state from unalerted to minor alerted as described in the alert states section. This means that you are mostly free to attack the eximus unit if you are out of their LoS, even if you are doing multiple attacks like with a melee weapon or just shooting multiple times with a gun.

**Stun the normal enemies, and take out Eximus first.** As a general rule of thumb, this is what you should do, given that it wouldn't alert any other enemies. While leveling something, you should bring a separate, silent weapon that you can take down the eximus units at range. Snipers are a good choice, given that you are not already using that slot.

### The exceptions: Gear Choices

> Depending on your gear choices, there might be some exceptions how you should run the mission.

One of the exceptions would be if you are using an AoE (Area of Effect) weapon such as the Kuva Bramma, which is used by many, or an otherwise very powerful weapon. These are hard categorize, and more up to your own experience and preference, which you will develop over time.&#x20;

The main point, is overpowering the eximus units. If your attacks are powerful enough, such as with the Kuva Bramma, or if you chose to use Banshee's Sonar, you can generally kill normal units and eximus units equally instead of singling out and killing the eximus first. \
Notably when using AoE weapons, you still have to ensure that eximus units _do not_ see their allies dying, see you, or see any passing projectiles. Test the waters. See if you prefer dealing with eximus units first, or just killing enemies equally to have higher speed through the mission. Remember that losing your stealth affinity bonus will result in a sizeable loss of potential affinity, and if it happens too often, it will ruin the efficiency of these runs.
