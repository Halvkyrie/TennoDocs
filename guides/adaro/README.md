# Adaro

Starting off with a bold claim? yes. Adaro can be great. It still cannot help you gain affinity on _completely_ everything though. You _can_ use it to grind affinity on anything you can bring into a regular mission.&#x20;

### **Disclaimer**

Please note that the methods and suggestions found here are not the _only_ ways of doing this. You are free to experiment on your own, change things and do things differently.

## What is Adaro?

Adaro is a Grineer exterminate mission found on Sedna, using the Grineer Galleon tileset. When this doc/guide refers to "Doing Adaro", it refers to doing  the mission and utilizing various game mechanics and abilities to gain a high amount of affinity by taking advantage of the stealth kill affinity bonus. There are several variations on how to do this, but gaining affinity to level equipment or gain Focus is the end goal.
