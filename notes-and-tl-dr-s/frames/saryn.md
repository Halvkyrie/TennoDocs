# Saryn

Saryn is all about her spores. The key to playing her effectively is knowing how her spores work, how they spread

Note: The game changes over time, and frames can change too. Make sure to check if there have been any recent changes to the frame and its mechanics

## Abilities

1. Spores
2. Molt
3. Toxic Lash
4. Miasma

## Ability Interactions/Synergies

**Toxic Lash** - This adds toxin, and is a separate hit instance. This is useful for effects that act per hit, such as \[Hati-Satya] for the Soma Prime.\
Additionally, the toxin damage from Toxic Lash does not combine with any other elements, meaning this can be useful for covering toxin for the Profit Taker fight, and allows using elemental combos like Viral + Toxin. This also means there is no need for concern about the elements on your equipped weapons mixing into something you don't want (eg viral + heat does _not_ become viral + gas)

## How do spores spread?

* When Patient Zero dies
* When a Spore is hit directly
* When an enemy is killed by a player or ally/companion
* When an enemy dies under the effect of Miasma
* When an enemy is hit by a weapon with Toxic Lash active

"An Enemy" would mean an enemy affected by spores\
"Patient Zero" means the target unit the ability was cast on

## Some usage tips

Cast your spores on a target, cast Toxic Lash (and this should generally be kept active at all times to ensure easy spore spreading).\
Shoot the target to start your spore spread. If you are playing on a large map, you might want to cast your spores on a unit in a different area to start a new "wave" of spores spreading.\
Especially if your affected target count is low, try to shoot/kill units affected by spores to bump up the spread again\
Casting Miasma when the enemy density is high is great, as this allows for rapid spreading (and rapid death) of spores
